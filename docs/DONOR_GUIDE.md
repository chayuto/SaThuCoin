## What is SaThuCoin?

SaThuCoin (SATHU) is a digital token on the Base network that recognizes verified charitable donations. The name comes from **สาธุ** (*sa-thu*), a Thai and Buddhist expression of blessing and approval, often spoken after an act of generosity. When your donation is confirmed, SATHU tokens are sent directly to your wallet as a permanent record of your generosity.

## Step 1: Create a Wallet

You need a crypto wallet to receive SATHU tokens. We recommend MetaMask — it's free and takes about 2 minutes.

1. Install MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) (browser extension or mobile app)
2. Follow the setup prompts to create a new wallet
3. Write down your recovery phrase and store it somewhere safe — this is the only way to recover your wallet

## Step 2: Copy Your Wallet Address

1. Open MetaMask
2. Your address is displayed at the top (starts with `0x`)
3. Click it to copy

Your wallet address looks like this: `0x1a2B3c4D5e6F...`

This is safe to share — it's like an email address. Anyone can send tokens to it, but only you can access them.

## Step 3: Provide Your Address to the Donation Organization

When making your donation, include your wallet address. The organization will use it to verify your donation and trigger your SATHU reward.

## Step 4: Check Your Balance

After your donation is verified, SATHU tokens will appear in your wallet. To see them:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Import tokens" at the bottom of the Assets tab
3. Select "Custom token"
4. Paste the contract address: `0x974FCaC6add872B946917eD932581CA9f7188AbD`
5. Token symbol (SATHU) and decimals (18) will fill in automatically
6. Click "Add custom token"

Your SATHU balance will now show in MetaMask alongside your other assets.

You can also view your balance on the block explorer:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does this cost me anything?**
No. Receiving SATHU tokens is free. You do not need any ETH or cryptocurrency in your wallet to receive tokens.

**Which network is this on?**
Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network built by Coinbase. MetaMask works with Base — you may need to add the Base network in MetaMask settings (chain ID: 8453).

**Can I use a different wallet?**
Yes. Any wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens on the Base network will work (Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, etc.).

**Is my wallet address the same as my Ethereum address?**
Yes. Your address works on both Ethereum and Base. You do not need a separate address.

**What is a boon?**
A "boon" (Thai: บุญ, meaning *merit* or *good deed*) is the smallest unit of SATHU — like a wei is to ETH. 1 SATHU = 10¹⁸ boon. The name reflects the Buddhist tradition of merit-making through generosity.

**What can I do with SATHU?**
SATHU is a recognition token. It serves as a permanent, verifiable record of your donation on the blockchain. You can hold it, transfer it, or view it on the block explorer.
